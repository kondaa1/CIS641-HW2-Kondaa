## Technical Background
I worked in the telecom industry for 7 years in various domains (like a developer inDBA team, worked as Business Analyst and then worked as Scrum Master for 1 year).
As a business Analyst I have worked with different people from different cultural backgrounds which helped me in my personal growth and also I learned about different cultures.
Working as scrum master was very tough as I needed to handle my team members' requests and make sure we are meeting the timelines of deliverables.

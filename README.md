# Arun Mohan Konda
* I like to play outdoor games like soccer and cricket.
* I love to work on SQL/PLSQL and explore DB related languages.
* I used to do photography as one of my favirite hobby but recently not doing much.

## Technical Background
I worked in the telecom industry for 7 years in various domains (like a developer in DBA team, worked as Business Analyst and then worked as Scrum Master for 1 year).
As a business Analyst I have worked with different people from different cultural backgrounds which helped me in my personal growth and also I learned about different cultures.
Working as scrum master was very tough as I needed to handle my team members' requests and make sure we are meeting the timelines of deliverables. Working as a developer in DBA was very exciting and I learned a lot about SQLs.
